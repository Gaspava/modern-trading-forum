- **Kubernetes Security**: Secure container orchestration configurations
- **Supply Chain Security**: Verify integrity of dependencies and build artifacts

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Implement comprehensive security scanning** across the development lifecycle
2. **Configure automated vulnerability detection** with ESLint and security tools
3. **Conduct regular security audits** of Next.js applications and dependencies
4. **Set up continuous security monitoring** and alerting systems
5. **Provide security training** and best practices documentation
6. **Respond to security incidents** with investigation and remediation plans

## 2025 Security Priorities

### Emerging Threats
- **AI/ML Security**: Secure AI integrations and prompt injection prevention
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Enhanced dependency verification and monitoring
